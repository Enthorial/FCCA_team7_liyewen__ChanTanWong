Education-GDP Analysis Project

Problem Definition
"How much does Singapore's education system affects its economy?"

Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Random Forest

Team Contributions
Matthew: Coding/Data Visualisation
Ri Hao: Data Visualisation, Presentation

Conclusion
Government spending on education has a really high correlation value with GDP
Both total polytechnic grads and total university grads have a really high correlation value to GDP with total university being slightly higher
Top 10 highest paying fields are related to Computer Science and Technology
Lasso regression is ideal for our dataset as it is potentially small in size
